## About me

Hello! I am **Javier Manotas Ruiz**, a computer engineering student at the University of A Coru√±a.
My main hobby is programming.
I develop video games for the Play Store account **JHandSoft**. You can find them [here](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=JHandSoft&c=apps&hl=es).
Despite of working with OOP most of the time, I love functional programming (Ocaml, F#...).

## About this repository

In this repository, you will find both my games and other personal projects that I find interesting.

Some of the projects are old because in the past I didn't use github but I decided to add them anyway.

## Self-taught Skills

- **Game Engines**: Pygame, Unity, Godot
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C#, C++, HLSL, GLSL
- **Other Tools**: Inkscape
